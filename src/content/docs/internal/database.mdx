FerrumC uses the LMDB database for storing data in a key-value format, allowing for fast and efficient data storage and
retrieval. Currently, this is used exclusively for storing chunks, but in the future this will be expanded to store other
data such as player data and entities.

There are several layers of abstraction in place to make working with the database easier. <br/>
Firstly there are some functions in `/src/lib/storage/src/lmdb.rs` that vastly simplify the process of interacting with
the database. These function provide a simple interface for reading and writing data to the database through the use of
functions such as `get()`, `insert()`, `delete()`, and `update()`, etc. Most of these functions work with a 128-bit key,
a table name as a string and an array of bytes as the value. <br/>
Inside most of these functions, tokio is used to spawn a blocking task, relegating the non-async database operations to
a separate task to prevent blocking the main thread. This is done by using the `tokio::task::spawn_blocking()` function.
This does require some ownership shenanigans, hence the Env being wrapped in an Arc and cloned before entering the
blocking task. <br/>
These functions can be used by anything, but does offer a fairly primitive interface. Code needing to interact with the
database should have their own wrappers for handling things like caching or serializing/deserializing data.

There is a second layer of abstract for chunks, found in `/src/lib/world/src/db_functions.rs`. These functions are
specifically for handling chunk data, and provide a more high-level interface for working with chunks.
These functions handle caching, serializing/deserializing, and converting coordinates and the dimension name into a key.

The specifics of caching are covered in a separate section, but the general idea is that chunks are stored in a cache
any time they are read or written, and are removed from the cache when a time or size cap is hit. <br/>
Serializing is currently done using the [bitcode](https://crates.io/crates/bitcode/) crate, which is a simple and
performant way to serialize and deserialize data. This is used to serialize the chunk data into a byte array, which is
then stored in the database, using the aforementioned primitive functions. There is also a compression step used to
decrease the amount of disk space a world takes up<br/>
Generating the key is done in the `create_key()` function, which takes a dimension name, an x coordinate and a z
coordinate and produces a 128-bit key. This key is then used to interact with the database. This key is created by first
hashing the dimension name with [wyhash](https://crates.io/crates/wyhash) and shifting the 64 bit digest into a 128-bit
key as the first 32 bits. The x and z coordinates are then widened to 48-bit integers and shifted into the remaining
96 bits. This ensures that the dimension name has sufficient a keyspace to not risk hash collisions with many dimensions
and the x and z coordinates can be sufficiently large to not limit the world size.<br/>
