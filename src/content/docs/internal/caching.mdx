description: Docs for the chunk caching system in FerrumC.

FerrumC uses a caching system to ensure that chunk loading is as fast as possible, since that is one of the noticeable
performance bottlenecks in Minecraft servers. However, the major bottleneck in sending chunks to client is the network
delay which can't really be fixed, so we try to focus on reducing the load on the rest of the server and maintaining low
memory usage.

FerrumC uses the [moka](https://crates.io/crates/moka) crate to provide a tried and tested caching system. This crate
provides both a sync and async cache, but FerrumC uses the async cache to prevent blocking the main thread. The general
premise of caching is that it can store chunks in memory, reducing the amount of time spent reading chunks from the much
slower disk storage.

The cache is a simple key-value store, where the key is a 128-bit integer and the value is a `Chunk` struct. The key is
generated from the dimension name, x coordinate and z coordinate of the chunk, the specifics of which are covered in the
[database section](./database). This key is then used to interact with the cache, where the cache will return an
`Option<Chunk>` when a chunk is requested. If the chunk is not in the cache, the cache will return `None`, and the chunk
will need to be read from the database.

All of this is handled automatically by the abstractions in `/src/lib/world/src/db_functions.rs`. These functions generally
contain 2 parts: a crate-level internal function that fetches directly from the database, and a public function that fetches
from the cache, falling back to the internal functions if the chunk can't be found. The public function will first check
the cache for the chunk, and if it is not found, it will call the internal function to fetch the chunk from the database.

FerrumC uses a very aggressive, simple caching system; any time a chunk is read or written, it is stored in the cache.
This includes when a chunk is generated, loaded from disk, or modified. This means that the cache will often have a lot
of unneeded chunks in it, but this results in very few cache misses for chunks that are frequently accessed.

The cache is also limited in size, both by time and by the number of chunks. The cache will remove the oldest chunks
when the cache reaches a certain size, and will also remove chunks when they have been in the cache for a certain amount
without being accessed. For example if we set the cache capacity to 20mb and the TTL to 60 seconds (these are the defaults),
the cache will remove the oldest chunks when the cache reaches 20mb, and will also remove chunks that have been in the cache
for 60 seconds without being accessed. This means there is a hard cap of 20mb on the cache, and that chunks that are not
frequently accessed will be removed from the cache to prevent unnecessary memory usage.

Setting the TTL higher will allow the cache to store chunks for longer, but will also mean the chunk's idle memory usage
will go down slower. This results in chunks being able to not be accessed for a longer time before being removed from the
cache, but also means that the cache will use more memory. <br/>
Setting the cache capacity higher will allow the cache to store more chunks, but will also mean that the cache will use more
memory. Setting this higher is useful if you have many players online at once, as it will allow the cache to store more chunks
and reduce the amount of time spent reading chunks from disk.
